# stan_clogit
Example code for fitting a conditional logistic regression using Stan. This code is largely untested so at this point should be considered untrustworthy. I've checked that the results match `survival::clogit` in `R` for just one model, and the estimates look reasonable (run `clogit_stan.r` to see for yourself).
